# Slick's Slices

## Why Did I Build This?

I built this to learn more about Gatsby (pros and cons) as well as how different parts of a JAMStack app fit together

## How Do You Use This?

1. The index page has an editable list of slicemasters (employees) and pies available by the slice in a fictional pizzeria
2. The Pizzas page is filterable by ingredient (one at a time right now), and displays a leaf if all the ingredients are vegetarian
3. The slicemasters page is paginated to display 3 at a time
4. The orders page takes your name and email, as well as your order, and sends an email detailing the order (currently does not work as I need to migrate to a real transactional email service which costs money)
